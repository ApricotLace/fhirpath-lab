 create an item to capture a US postcode with validation on the format

**FhirPath AI:**
 To create a Questionnaire item that captures a US postcode with validation on the format, you can add an item with a regular expression constraint. The constraint is added using the SDC extension `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex`. Here's a suitable Questionnaire resource with the new item included:

```questionnaire
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  "id": "sample-postcode",
  "status": "active",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "1",
      "text": "US Postcode",
      "type": "string",
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex",
          "valueString": "^\\d{5}(-\\d{4})?$"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the `regex` extension is used to validate the input as a valid US postal code, allowing both five-digit codes and those with the optional four-digit extension separated by a hyphen.

 Add a root level group with the title "Demo"

**FhirPath AI:**
 To add a root-level group with the title "Demo", you can add a new item of type `"group"` to the Questionnaire resource. Here's the updated Questionnaire:

```questionnaire
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  "id": "sample-postcode",
  "status": "active",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "1",
      "text": "Demo",
      "type": "group",
      "item": [
        {
          "linkId": "1.1",
          "text": "US Postcode",
          "type": "string",
          "extension": [
            {
              "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex",
              "valueString": "^\\d{5}(-\\d{4})?$"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, I've encapsulated the existing "US Postcode" item within a new group item with the title "Demo" by updating the `"linkId"` values to follow the item hierarchy.

 Add a title for the questionnaire

**FhirPath AI:**
 To add a title for the Questionnaire, simply include a `"title"` field at the root level of the resource. Here's the updated Questionnaire with the title added:

```questionnaire
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  "id": "sample-postcode",
  "status": "active",
  "title": "Postcode Demo",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "1",
      "text": "Demo",
      "type": "group",
      "item": [
        {
          "linkId": "1.1",
          "text": "US Postcode",
          "type": "string",
          "extension": [
            {
              "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex",
              "valueString": "^\\d{5}(-\\d{4})?$"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, I added the `"title"` field with the value "Postcode Demo".

 How can I resolve this issue from validating the Questionnaire?

Questionnaire requires a canonical URL

Location: `Questionnaire.url`

**FhirPath AI:**
 To resolve the issue about the missing canonical URL, you need to add a `"url"` field at the root level of the Questionnaire resource. The `"url"` should be a unique identifier for the Questionnaire, typically following a structure which includes your organization's domain and the resource type and ID information.

Here's an example of the updated Questionnaire with a `"url"` field added:

```questionnaire
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  "id": "sample-postcode",
  "url": "http://example.com/fhir/Questionnaire/sample-postcode",
  "status": "active",
  "title": "Postcode Demo",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "1",
      "text": "Demo",
      "type": "group",
      "item": [
        {
          "linkId": "1.1",
          "text": "US Postcode",
          "type": "string",
          "extension": [
            {
              "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex",
              "valueString": "^\\d{5}(-\\d{4})?$"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, I added the `"url"` field with the value "http://example.com/fhir/Questionnaire/sample-postcode". You should replace "http://example.com" with your organization's domain to make the URL unique and appropriate for your organization.

**Author:**
 Based on the FHIR Questionnaire
``` json
  {"resourceType":"Questionnaire","id":"sample-postcode","url":"http://example.com/fhir/Questionnaire/sample-postcode","status":"active","title":"Postcode Demo","item":[{"linkId":"1","text":"Demo","type":"group","item":[{"linkId":"1.1","text":"US Postcode","type":"string","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex","valueString":"^\\d{5}(-\\d{4})?$"}]}]}]}

```

 Instead of using the regex extension, can you update this to a constraint expression using the regex expression so that it can have a custom error messaeg "Incorrectly formatted postal code"

**FhirPath AI:**
 To update the Questionnaire with a constraint expression instead of using the `regex` extension, you can add a new `constraint` field to the item with the custom error message. Here's the updated Questionnaire resource:

```questionnaire
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  "id": "sample-postcode",
  "url": "http://example.com/fhir/Questionnaire/sample-postcode",
  "status": "active",
  "title": "Postcode Demo",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "1",
      "text": "Demo",
      "type": "group",
      "item": [
        {
          "linkId": "1.1",
          "text": "US Postcode",
          "type": "string",
          "constraint": [
            {
              "key": "us-postcode-format",
              "severity": "error",
              "human": "Incorrectly formatted postal code",
              "expression": "matches('^(\\d{5})(-\\d{4})?$')"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, I removed the `regex` extension and added a `constraint` field with a unique `key`, a `severity` level of `"error"`, a custom error message as `human`, and the FHIRPath `expression` that checks if the given string matches the postal code format. The FHIRPath `matches()` function has been used with the same regex pattern.
